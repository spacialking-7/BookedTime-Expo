My reflection

The problem my app is addressing is that people aren't reading as much as they used to. 
This app could be used by casual readers, students, parents, teachers.

The core app idea  is a stop watch that stores your reading sessions inside the history tab once the stopwatch is stopped.

My app curently is functional and cohesively designed but is missing extra fancy features like my monster card integration idea for the awards. 

The biggest problem I still have is on my bottom tabs I have 3 tabs : Home, History and Achivements but they all say "home/index", "history/index", "achivements/index"

I need to recheck folder/file structure because the profile section is not working again ("Unmatched Route Page could not be found. http://localhost:8081").


Problems I faced: 

I  had just adjusted to the previous native react App.JS method and I was not used to expo type navigation. The folder strucuture kept bringing up a route issue. I had to make index.js inside app/ and reroute it to the homepage in tabs. The folder structure was also making certain screens appear as a bottom tab so I had to make a session folder. 

I had 2 top headers showing because tab headers had show headers on once removed I moved the profile modal to be triggered by edit profile. I now have one top header 


Overall, this project helped me understand how sensitive Expo Router is to folder structure and how important it is to organize screens correctly from the start.
